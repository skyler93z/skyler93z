## 👋 About Me  
I’m a Master’s student in Statistics at the University of Victoria, with hands-on experience in **biostatistics**, **financial data analysis**, and **applied statistical research**. My work bridges both academic research and real-world applications, ranging from **Monte Carlo simulation**, **scRNA-seq data analysis**, to **mathematical modeling** in award-winning international competitions.

I am passionate about turning data into insight and building robust, reproducible, and scalable solutions through R, Python, and HPC tools. I actively contribute to research collaborations, open-source development, and mentorship in the field of data science.
